                         Commons SCXML Package
                             Version 0.9
                            Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Commons SCXML 0.9 is a minor release containing a few enhancements and
bug fixes. Changes to SCXML documents may be necessary before upgrading
from 0.8, see detailed changes list below. See about section at the end
for general information on Commons SCXML.

BREAKING CHANGES:

 o The "event" attribute of the <send> element is now correctly evaluated
   as an expression, rather than a String.

 o In line with the rest of the logs used in the library, the default
   SCXMLSemantics implementation now uses SCXMLSemantics.class to derive
   its log name, instead of the previous logical name "scxml.app.log".

NEW FEATURES:

 o [SCXML-74] - <data> should support use of id attribute
 o [SCXML-75] - TriggerEvent should be Serializable
 o [SCXML-78] - SCXMLListeners are not be processed in a defined order
 o [SCXML-80] - SCXMLParser should throw exception if it fails to resolve the
                src attribute of the <state> element
 o [SCXML-81] - <parallel> does not support <onentry> and <onexit>
 o [SCXML-82] - <transition> element as an child of <parallel> ignored
 o [SCXML-84] - Add SCXML on Android usecase to website
 o [SCXML-86] - Support initial attribute of <state>

BUG FIXES:

 o [SCXML-73] - <send> delay attribute should be a value expression
 o [SCXML-76] - Serialization of expressions may produce invalid XML
 o [SCXML-77] - <param> semantics for using name attribute by itself are
                not correct
 o [SCXML-79] - SCXMLSerializer produces nested states with a parentid
                attribute
 o [SCXML-83] - Errors on serialization of <send>
 o [SCXML-87] - Delayed events not passing payload
 o [SCXML-88] - SCXMLSerializer does not serialize custom namespace
                declarations
 o [SCXML-89] - <assign> does not remove all previous children at location
 o [SCXML-90] - event attribute of <send> is not evaluated as an expression

OTHER COMMENTS:

 o This is a Maven 2 release.

ABOUT COMMONS SCXML:

The Commons SCXML (State Chart XML) project provides a generic
state-machine based execution environment. It borrows most semantics
from its namesake Working Draft at the W3C. Anything that can be
represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view
navigation bits, interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can
leverage the Commons SCXML library. The library abstracts out the
environment interfaces, and can be used in numerous server-side and
client-side runtimes.
