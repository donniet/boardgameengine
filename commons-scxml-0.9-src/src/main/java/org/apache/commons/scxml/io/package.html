  <p>A collection of classes for reading in and writing out SCXML
     documents, to and from the Commons SCXML Java object model.</p>

  <p>Two variants of the SCXML parser are present in this package:
    <ul>
      <li><code>SCXMLDigester</code> represents the parser that
          corresponds to the July 05 Working Draft, and will be
          removed in v1.0. It will be present all v0.x releases for
          backwards compatability reasons.</li>
      <li><code>SCXMLParser</code> represents the newer version.
          This will be updated to keep up with the more recent
          Working Drafts.</li>
    </ul>
