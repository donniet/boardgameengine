/**
 * <p>The Invoker interface is used to define the possible interactions
 * between the parent state machine (executor) and the types of invocable
 * activities.</p>
 *
 * <p>Invocable activities must first register an Invoker implementation class
 * for the appropriate "targettype" (attribute of &lt;invoke&gt;) with the
 * parent <code>SCXMLExecutor</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The communication link between the parent state machine executor and
 * the invoked activity is a bi-directional events pipe.</p>
 *
 * <p>All events triggered on the parent state machine get forwarded to the
 * invoked activity. The processing semantics for these events depend
 * upon the "targettype", and thereby vary per concrete implementation of
 * this interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>The invoked activity in turn must fire a special "done" event
 * when it concludes. It may fire additional events before the "done"
 * event. The semantics of any additional events depend upon the
 * "targettype". The invoked activity must not fire any events after the
 * "done" event. The name of the special "done" event must be
 * the ID of the parent state wherein the corresponding &lt;invoke&gt;
 * resides, with the String ".invoke.done" appended.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Invoker "lifecycle" is outlined below:
 *  <ol>
 *   <li>Instantiation via {@link Class#newInstance()}
 *       (Invoker implementation requires accessible constructor).</li>
 *   <li>Configuration (setters for parent state ID and
 *       {@link SCInstance}).</li>
 *   <li>Initiation of invoked activity via invoke() method, passing
 *       the source URI and the map of params.</li>
 *   <li>Zero or more bi-directional event triggering.</li>
 *   <li>Either completion or cancellation.</li>
 *  </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The semantics of &lt;invoke&gt; are necessarily
 * asynchronous, tending towards long(er) running interactions with external
 * processes. Implementations must not communicate with the parent state
 * machine executor in a synchronous manner. For synchronous
 * communication semantics, use &lt;event&gt; or custom actions instead.</p>
