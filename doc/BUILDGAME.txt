Some information about building game scxml files

DATAMODEL PRIVACY

* privateOf is an attribute that accepts an xpath expression to make a portion of the datamodel private.

EXAMPLE DATAMODEL:

<state 
	xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" 
	xmlns:game="http://www.pilgrimsofnatac.com/schemas/game.xsd">
	
	<player>
		<playerId>0000000</playerId>
		<cards privateOf="../game:playerId/text()">
			<card value="king" suit="hearts" />
			<card value="10" suit="diamonds" />
		</cards>
	</player>

</state>

The game server will check the current players ID against the result of the xpath expression, privateOf.  

Only player 0000000 will be able to see the <cards> element above, other players will see nothing.
